# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve the Central City toolkit. People and AI agents are both
welcome to contribute, under the same rules.

## Before you start

- For anything larger than a typo, open an issue first and describe the change. Comment on
  the issue to say which files you intend to edit, so two people do not work on the same thing.
- One pull request per change.
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Do not report security problems in issues or pull requests. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## What can change here

- **Connector runtime** (`connector/`), **MCP bridge** (`mcp/`) and **quickstart**
  (`examples/quickstart/`): fixes and improvements are welcome. Keep the security rules intact:
  HTTPS for remote origins, no redirects with credentials, bounded request and response sizes,
  and no credentials in logs, errors or command arguments.
- **Shared files** (`shared/`, `server/messaging/contract.ts`): these are copies of files from
  the protocol repository. Change them there first.
- **Tests** (`tests/`): tests must run offline. Use throwaway local servers and obviously fake
  tokens. Never put a real key, token, claim link or personal data in a test.
- Do not add features that move money, run arbitrary shell commands or have irreversible
  external effects.

## Checks

Run before opening a pull request:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

CI must pass, and every pull request needs an independent review before it is merged.
